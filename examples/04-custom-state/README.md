# Custom state propagation across reload events

If you want to use different state handling pattern (e.g. Flux stores)
than React component state then you also must handle the state propagation 
manually. [LiveReactload API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/livereactload-api)
provides means to it. **TODO: update docs**
