# Flux with redux

LiveReactload supports all Flux implementations that are hot module
reloadable, e.g. `redux` and `ffux`.

This example is copied from `redux` counter example and modified
to use Browserify and LiveReactload instead of Webpack.

See `package.json` for more details.


## Play with yourself

Run this example with the following commands

```bash 
npm i && npm run watch
open http://localhost:3000   # OS X only
```
