# Basic LiveReactload usage

This example demonstrates a watch script that can be used for 
live code editing. Script's contents can be found from `scripts/dev`.
Usage is simple, run the following command with your terminal:

    ./scripts/dev

Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and start editing files
from `public` folder - changes should be propagated immediately
to the page.
