# ES6 classes

If you want to use new ES6 class notation (your ES6 class extends
`React.Component`), it is possible with LiveReactload. No additional
configuration is needed.

Note that LiveReactload does not support private class exposing of
ES6 classes so only exported classes are live reloadable.
